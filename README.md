## Analysis & Visualizations

The following section provides **chart-wise analysis**, directly interpreting the graphs and screenshots included in the repository.

---

### 1. Monthly Stock Comparison (Bar Chart)

**Analysis:**
The bar chart comparing monthly stock levels across product categories shows uneven stock distribution. Certain categories consistently maintain high stock levels even during low-demand months, while fast-moving categories experience tighter stock availability.

**Insight:**
This imbalance indicates inefficient capital utilization, where money is locked in slow-moving inventory.

**Business Impact:**
Optimizing stock levels based on historical demand can reduce overstocking and ensure better availability of high-demand products.

---

### 2. Stock Allocation by Category (Pie Chart)

**Analysis:**
The pie chart highlights that a significant portion of inventory is concentrated in a few categories, primarily Apparel and Women’s Wear, followed by accessories such as backpacks.

**Insight:**
These categories dominate shelf space, confirming their importance in overall sales contribution.

**Business Impact:**
Maintaining optimal safety stock for these categories is critical, while less space can be allocated to low-performing items.

---

### 3. Pareto Analysis – Inventory Items (80/20 Rule)

**Analysis:**
The Pareto chart shows that approximately **20–30% of products account for nearly 70–80% of total sales value**.

**Insight:**
A small number of products drive most of the revenue, validating the Pareto principle in retail inventory management.

**Business Impact:**
Management should prioritize forecasting, replenishment, and supplier negotiations for these critical items.

---

### 4. Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)

**Analysis:**
The sales trend line chart shows clear seasonality. Sales peak during **November**, corresponding to festive demand, and drop significantly in **January**, indicating post-festival slowdown.

**Insight:**
Customer purchasing behavior is highly influenced by seasonal and festival periods.

**Business Impact:**
Advance stocking and promotional campaigns before festive months can significantly improve revenue.

---

### 5. Monthly Profit Trend (Line Chart)

**Analysis:**
Although sales increase during peak months, profit margins do not always rise proportionally. This suggests higher discounting or increased procurement costs during high-demand periods.

**Insight:**
High sales volume does not automatically translate into higher profitability.

**Business Impact:**
Cost control, supplier negotiation, and margin-based pricing strategies are essential during peak seasons.

---

### 6. Product-wise Sales Contribution (Pareto Chart)

**Analysis:**
The chart indicates that **Women’s Wear, Apparel, and Backpacks together contribute nearly 70% of total sales**.

**Insight:**
Customer preference is clearly skewed toward fashion-related products.

**Business Impact:**
Focused marketing, improved visual merchandising, and variety expansion in these categories can further boost revenue.

---

### 7. Seasonal Demand Analysis

**Analysis:**
Sales data across months confirms strong festival-driven demand, with November as the highest-performing month and January as the weakest.

**Insight:**
Demand forecasting must account for cultural and seasonal buying patterns.

**Business Impact:**
Running clearance sales during low-demand months can help reduce excess inventory and improve cash flow.

---
